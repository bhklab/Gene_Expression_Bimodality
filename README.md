# Gene_Expression_Bimodality

## Introduction
This is a repo that contains the code used to do the computational analyses in this paper:

Ba-Alawi, W., Nair, S. K., Li, B., Mammoliti, A., Smirnov, P., Mer, A. S., Penn, L., & Haibe-Kains, B. (2020). *Bimodality of gene expression in cancer patient tumors as interpretable biomarkers for drug sensitivity*. BioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.08.288688

The script for the analyses is written in R.


----

## Dependencies:
These R packages need to be installed in order to run the analysis script:
- Biobase
- PharmacoGx
- ggplot2
- GSA
- piano
- fgsea
- dplyr


----
## Reproducibility of the Analysis:
- Once the project is downloaded to the user computer, the user needs to navigate to the main directory of the project "Gene_Expression_Bimodality-master".
- Inside the main directory, there is an R script file named "Bimodality_project.R". Running this script will regenerate the different plots used in the paper

<br>
*Important Note 1:* the user needs to set the working directory inside the script file before running it, i.e. setting the working directory to "Gene_Expression_Bimodality-master"
