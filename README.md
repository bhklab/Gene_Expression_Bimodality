# Gene_Expression_Bimodality

## Introduction
This is a repo that contains the code used to do the bioinfomatics analyses in this paper:

Bimodality of gene expression in cancer patient tumors as interpretable biomarkers for drug sensitivity, 2020, Ba-Alawi et. al..

The script for the analyses is written in R.


----

## Dependencies:
These R packages need to be installed in order to run the analysis script:
- Biobase
- PharmacoGx
- ggplot2
- GSA
- piano
- fgsea
- dplyr


----
## Reproducibility of the Analysis:
- Once the project is downloaded to the user computer, the user needs to navigate to the main directory of the project "TNBC_BAY-876-master".
- Inside the main directory, there is an R script file named "run_analysis.R". Running this script will regenerate the different bioinformatics plots used in the paper

<br>
*Important Note 1:* the user needs to set the working directory inside the script file before running it, i.e. setting the working directory to "Gene_Expression_Bimodality-master"
